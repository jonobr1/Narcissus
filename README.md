## In order to build the project

+ First you need to get [cinder](http://libcinder.org/) built properly. Check these tutorials out for your specific os: [Mac](http://libcinder.org/docs/welcome/MacSetup.html) | [Windows](http://libcinder.org/docs/welcome/MSWSetup.html).
+ Then add Narcissus to the mix:

The Narcissus project builds in the same hierarchy as sample projects within the `cinder` directory. You can place the project there or in some other directory at a similar sub-level as the `samples` folder.

e.g I personally have a folder in my `cinder` directory labelled `apps` where I house Narcissus. Like so:

![cinder/apps/Narcissus](https://github.com/jonobr1/Narcissus/raw/master/README/hierarchy.png "Narcissus Folder Hierarchy")

Once you've placed or more precisely pulled the project into the proper place, simply double-click the xcode or vc10 project, build and run.

N.B â€” Currently the vc10 project only builds debug and has not been tested. This is due to a number of link issues that I can't figure out that you can learn more about [here](http://news.narcissus-app.com/post/3848920979/if-you-know-your-way-around-visual-studio-c-2010) and [here](http://forum.libcinder.org/#Topic/23286000000562009). __Build at your own risk!__

## 

+ Why am I putting my personal project and experimentation on GitHub? [This](http://news.narcissus-app.com/post/4096586009/ive-moved-all-the-source-files-online-to-github) is a relatively cohesive answer.
