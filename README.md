## In order to build:

The Narcissus project builds in the same hierarchy as sample projects within the `cinder` directory. You can place the project there or in some other directory at a similar sub-level as the `samples` folder.

e.g I personally have a folder in my `cinder` directory labelled `apps` where I house Narcissus.

Built with [cinder](http://libcinder.org/).
