## In order to build the project

The Narcissus project builds in the same hierarchy as sample projects within the `cinder` directory. You can place the project there or in some other directory at a similar sub-level as the `samples` folder.

e.g I personally have a folder in my `cinder` directory labelled `apps` where I house Narcissus. Like so:

![cinder/apps/Narcissus](https://github.com/jonobr1/Narcissus/raw/master/README/hierarchy.png "Narcissus Folder Hierarchy")

Once you've placed or more precisely pulled the project into the proper place, simply double-click the xcode project, build and run. (Windows project to come)
